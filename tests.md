# Manual Tests

## Pixel Home Swipe Overlay Watchdog

Feature/change name: Accessibility overlay visibility watchdog for Pixel Home swipe.

Prerequisites/setup:
- Pixel 7 Pro connected with USB debugging enabled.
- `Phone Whisper Codex` installed with the accessibility service enabled.
- Android SDK `adb` available.

Step-by-step actions:
1. Open `Phone Whisper Codex` on the phone.
2. Tap the `OpenAI API Key` setting to show a text field and keyboard.
3. Confirm the microphone overlay appears while the keyboard is visible.
4. Swipe up from the bottom to go Home.
5. Wait 1-2 seconds.
6. Confirm the microphone overlay disappears on the launcher screen.
7. Reopen the app and repeat in both light theme and dark theme.

Expected results:
- The microphone overlay appears when the keyboard is visible in the app.
- The microphone overlay disappears after Home swipe, even if Android does not emit a reliable keyboard hide event.
- Light theme result: overlay appears over the keyboard state and is removed on Home.
- Dark theme result: overlay appears over the keyboard state and is removed on Home.

Rollback/cleanup notes:
- Reinstall the previous APK if the watchdog causes unwanted overlay behavior.
- Disable the `Phone Whisper Codex` accessibility service to stop all overlay behavior.

## Custom Transcription API URL

Feature/change name: Configurable OpenAI-compatible transcription endpoint.

Prerequisites/setup:
- `Phone Whisper Codex` installed.
- Accessibility service and audio permission enabled.
- Cloud transcription enabled.
- A reachable OpenAI-compatible transcription endpoint, for example `http://100.68.233.33:6022/v1`.

Step-by-step actions:
1. Open `Phone Whisper Codex`.
2. Tap `API key / bearer token` and enter the bearer token expected by the custom endpoint.
3. Tap `Transcription API URL` and enter the endpoint base URL.
4. Open any app with a text field and focus it so the keyboard appears.
5. Tap the floating microphone button, record a short phrase, then tap again to stop.
6. Repeat in both light theme and dark theme.

Expected results:
- The app sends audio to `<base URL>/audio/transcriptions` when the base URL already ends in `/v1`.
- The request includes `Authorization: Bearer <token>` when a token is configured.
- The returned `text` value is inserted into the focused field, with clipboard fallback behavior preserved.
- Light theme result: endpoint settings are readable and transcription still inserts text.
- Dark theme result: endpoint settings are readable and transcription still inserts text.

Rollback/cleanup notes:
- Clear `Transcription API URL` with `Use default` to return to the official OpenAI endpoint.
- Disable cloud transcription to return to local transcription.

## Protected Bridge Token And Diagnostics

Feature/change name: Bearer token protected custom transcription with Android/server timing logs.

Prerequisites/setup:
- `Phone Whisper Codex` installed.
- Accessibility service and audio permission enabled.
- Cloud transcription enabled.
- Server bridge running at `http://whisper.webuirenat.duckdns.org/v1`.
- API key / bearer token set to the bridge token.
- Android `adb logcat` available for inspecting logs tagged `PhoneWhisper`.

Step-by-step actions:
1. Open `Phone Whisper Codex`.
2. Set `API key / bearer token` to the server bridge token.
3. Set `Transcription API URL` to `http://whisper.webuirenat.duckdns.org/v1`.
4. Open a text field in any app so the overlay appears.
5. Tap the microphone, record a short phrase, then tap again to stop.
6. Run `adb logcat -s PhoneWhisper` and confirm all entries for that attempt share the same `trace=<id>`.
7. Check the server bridge log and match the request by timestamp and request duration.
8. Repeat in both light theme and dark theme.

Expected results:
- Android logs include recording, WAV encoding, HTTP DNS/connect/upload/response, callback, post-processing, and injection stages with elapsed milliseconds.
- Server logs include bridge timing stages for the same request and show whether auth passed or failed.
- With the correct bearer token, transcription succeeds and inserts text.
- Without the bearer token, the server returns `401 Unauthorized`.
- Light theme result: token and endpoint settings remain readable and transcription succeeds.
- Dark theme result: token and endpoint settings remain readable and transcription succeeds.

Rollback/cleanup notes:
- Revert the API key and endpoint settings to previous values if testing another provider.
- Clear logcat after collecting diagnostics with `adb logcat -c` if needed.

## Clipboard Copy Toggle

Feature/change name: Optional transcript clipboard copy.

Prerequisites/setup:
- `Phone Whisper Codex` installed.
- Accessibility service and audio permission enabled.
- A working local or cloud transcription engine.
- A target app with an editable text field.

Step-by-step actions:
1. Open `Phone Whisper Codex`.
2. Turn `Copy transcript to clipboard` off.
3. Dictate into a focused editable field.
4. Confirm the text is inserted and the Android clipboard is not replaced by the transcript.
5. Turn `Copy transcript to clipboard` on.
6. Dictate again into a focused editable field.
7. Confirm the app may use paste actions and the transcript is available in the clipboard.
8. Repeat in both light theme and dark theme.

Expected results:
- When the toggle is off, the service does not call `ClipboardManager.setPrimaryClip` and only attempts direct `ACTION_SET_TEXT` insertion.
- When the toggle is on, the previous clipboard-backed paste fallback remains available.
- Light theme result: the toggle is readable and changes state correctly.
- Dark theme result: the toggle is readable and changes state correctly.

Rollback/cleanup notes:
- Turn `Copy transcript to clipboard` on to restore the previous clipboard-backed behavior.

## Direct Insert Placeholder And Feedback Regression

Feature/change name: Direct insertion must not prepend input hints or show success feedback.

Prerequisites/setup:
- `Phone Whisper Codex` installed from the current debug APK.
- Accessibility service and audio permission enabled.
- A working local or cloud transcription engine.
- `Copy transcript to clipboard` turned off.
- A target app with an empty editable field whose hint is visible, for example `Message` or `Сообщение`.

Step-by-step actions:
1. Open the target app and focus the empty text field so the hint is visible.
2. Tap the floating microphone button, record a short phrase, then tap again to stop.
3. Watch the overlay feedback while the text is inserted.
4. Inspect the final text in the field.
5. Repeat in both light theme and dark theme.

Expected results:
- The dictated text is inserted without prepending the hint text.
- Placeholder text such as `Message` or `Сообщение` is not converted into real message content.
- No `Inserted` success bubble is shown after successful direct insertion.
- Light theme result: insertion succeeds and no unwanted success bubble appears.
- Dark theme result: insertion succeeds and no unwanted success bubble appears.

Rollback/cleanup notes:
- Reinstall the previous APK if a target app depends on clipboard-backed paste behavior.
- Turn `Copy transcript to clipboard` on to allow the older paste-based fallback path.

## Kwork Trumbowyg Placeholder Regression

Feature/change name: Web rich-text placeholder cleanup for Kwork offer description.

Prerequisites/setup:
- `Phone Whisper Codex` installed from the current debug APK.
- Accessibility service and audio permission enabled.
- Cloud or local transcription working.
- `Copy transcript to clipboard` turned off.
- Android browser opened to `https://kwork.ru/new_offer?project=3173172`.
- The `Описание` editor is empty and shows the placeholder text.

Step-by-step actions:
1. Focus the empty Kwork `Описание` editor.
2. Tap the Phone Whisper floating microphone button.
3. Record a short phrase, then tap again to stop.
4. Inspect the inserted editor text.
5. Open `adb logcat -v time -s PhoneWhisper`.
6. Repeat in both light theme and dark theme.

Expected results:
- The inserted text does not include `Напишите, как вы будете решать задачу клиента`.
- Logcat includes `stage=inject_existing_text_ignored` with a placeholder-related reason.
- Real existing text is preserved when the cursor is inside non-placeholder content.
- The visual CSS placeholder may remain visible until the page receives another real input event; this is accepted because the placeholder is not part of the inserted text.
- Light theme result: the editor remains usable and the placeholder is not prepended.
- Dark theme result: the editor remains usable and the placeholder is not prepended.

Rollback/cleanup notes:
- Reinstall the previous APK if a specific web editor requires the older direct text behavior.
- Turn `Copy transcript to clipboard` on if a site works better with paste actions.

## Voice-Reactive Overlay And Retry

Feature/change name: Voice-reactive recording animation, in-button loader, and transient retry.

Prerequisites/setup:
- `Phone Whisper Codex` installed from the current debug APK.
- Accessibility service and audio permission enabled.
- A target app with an editable field focused so the overlay is visible.
- Cloud transcription configured for normal success testing.
- For retry testing, temporarily use an invalid transcription URL or disable network.

Step-by-step actions:
1. Focus a text field and confirm the idle microphone button appears.
2. Tap the microphone and speak at different volumes.
3. Confirm the recording ring grows/shrinks strongly with voice volume.
4. Confirm the microphone icon is hidden during recording and a three-bar equalizer is shown instead.
5. Tap again to stop recording.
6. Confirm the microphone icon disappears and a loader spins inside the button during transcription.
7. Restore a valid transcription endpoint and confirm successful text insertion returns the button to idle.
8. Set an invalid transcription URL or disable network.
9. Record and stop again.
10. Confirm a readable error feedback appears and the button changes to a retry icon.
11. Restore network/endpoint while keeping the overlay visible, then tap retry.
12. Hide the keyboard while retry is visible, then show the keyboard again.
13. Repeat visual checks in both light theme and dark theme.

Expected results:
- Recording animation reacts strongly to microphone input level, with the button itself scaling about five times more than the initial voice-reactive version.
- The recording icon is a three-bar equalizer whose bars move in a quick delayed wave from left to right.
- Transcribing state shows only the in-button loader, not the microphone icon.
- Failed transcription keeps the last audio available behind a retry button while the overlay stays visible.
- Tapping retry resubmits the saved audio without re-recording.
- Hiding the keyboard removes the overlay and clears retry state; showing it again displays the normal microphone.
- Common errors show readable feedback such as `Network error`, `Wrong transcription token`, or `Transcription server error`.
- Light theme result: all overlay states are visible and readable.
- Dark theme result: all overlay states are visible and readable.

Rollback/cleanup notes:
- Restore the normal transcription URL and token after failure testing.
- Reinstall the previous APK if retry behavior is not desired.
